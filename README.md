# What is TypeSense?

Typesense is a fast, open-source, typo-tolerant search engine designed for building lightning-fast, delightful search experiences in web and mobile apps, offering an easy-to-use alternative to complex systems like Elasticsearch. It's in-memory for speed, supports features like faceted search, vector search, and geo-search, and is popular for e-commerce and documentation sites needing instant, relevant results even with misspellings. 
Key Features

    Speed: Optimized for sub-50ms responses, often achieved by keeping the index in RAM.
    Typo Tolerance: Handles misspellings automatically, finding relevant results even with errors (e.g., "Dragoon" for "Dragon").
    Ease of Use: Provides a developer-friendly experience with a simple API and good defaults, reducing operational overhead.
    Open Source: Free to self-host, with a managed SaaS option (Typesense Cloud) available.
    Advanced Search: Supports filtering, faceting, geo-search, and vector search (for semantic similarity).
    Real-time Indexing: Updates search indexes almost instantly. 

Common Use Cases

    E-commerce: Product search with filtering and typo-tolerance.
    Documentation Sites: Quick, relevant search for help articles.
    Any App Needing Instant Search: E.g., user search, content discovery.
